# HarDClanZ Linux
Systemd-free distribution
### Goals
 - [X] Own package manager ([hpkg](https://github.com/EmptiedSoul/hpkg))
 - [X] Own repositories    ([packages](https://github.com/EmptiedSoul/hardclanz-packages))	
 - [X] Own init system     ([init](https://github.com/EmptiedSoul/hardclanz-init))
 - [X] Overall simplicity
### Philosophy
We are trying to create simple (but featureful) distribution, avoiding enormous and fancy stuff such as systemd, python etc<br/>
HarDClanZ Linux's tools written in C and mostly bash, keeping its codebase short, simple and easy to use and modify<br/>
